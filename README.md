# Weather App

Simple weather application that can grab the week's forecast by fetching weather API based on location detected. Created with React.js and webpack. The application can detect your location(if allowed) and check the week's weather, including humidity and wind pressure. The graph component detects temperature variation for the next 7 days. The searchbar component gives you the option to search the weather by zip code or location(city or state).
