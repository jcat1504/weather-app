1. Always initialize state in constructor.
2. constructor, componentWillMount and componentDidMount are called only once in the entire lifecycle of the component.
3. Component is re-rendered on prop and state change.
4. Do not change state in componentWillUpdate (Look for setState OK and NO setState in above lifecycle diagram).
5. Always use setState() method to update state.
